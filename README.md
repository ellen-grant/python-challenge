# Python Challenges
## Two Python challenges are presented in this project, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where my newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.



## PyBank Challenge

In this project, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of the company data. A financial dataset called budget_data.csv is given. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

  The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

  The total number of months included in the dataset

  The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

  The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period



In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.


## PyPoll Challenge

In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

A set of poll data called election_data.csv is given. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

  The total number of votes cast

  A complete list of candidates who received votes

  The percentage of votes each candidate won

  The total number of votes each candidate won

  The winner of the election based on popular vote
  
  
In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
