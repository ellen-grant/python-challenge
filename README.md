## Python Challenges
In this project, two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll, are presented. Both tasks present a real-world situation where my newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

# PyBank Challenge

In this project, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of the company data. A financial dataset called budget_data.csv is given. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period



In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
